# Processor Design for Machine Learning (ML) 
Welcome to the ML Processor Design Hub â€” a curated collection of hardware design projects that explore how to implement and accelerate machine learning algorithms using custom processors built in Verilog HDL.

This repository is meant for students, hardware enthusiasts, and engineers who want to explore how core ML concepts can be brought to life using digital logic and architectural design techniques.

Before diving in, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic digital design concepts (registers, FSMs, ALUs)
- Basic to intermediate Verilog
- Basic computer architecture (datapath, control, memory)
- (Optional) Introductory machine learning concepts
